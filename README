Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'YouTube Monitor' is a daemon that will poll YouTube's RSS feeds for new
videos. As new videos are discovered, they will be placed in one or more HTML
lists for viewing by the user.

The terms and conditions for use of this software is provided in the included
'LICENSE' file.
The included YouTube logo is seperately copyrighted by it's respective owner.

To install:
*) Place this directory ('ytm') in the place of your choosing.
*) Run 'compile.sh'
*) Use the files 'start.sh' and 'stop.sh' to start and stop the daemon. It
   is up to you to configure the system to do this for you if you so desire.
*) Prepare the configuration file (by default, 'config.xml').


Configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The configuration file is a standard XML file:
The root element must be 'youtubemonitor'.

The required element 'paths' the specifies directories, absolute or relative
to this directory, that the daemon will read and write stuff to.
The attribute 'data' specifies the directory that contains needed static
files; which may be safely kept in '/usr/share'.
The attribute 'cache' specifies the directory that will be used to store
files fetched from the web and generated by the daemon, this must be writable
to by the daemon; and may be safely kept in '/usr/var/tmp'.
These directories must be readable by any user who wishes to see any lists,
but writablity is not required nor encouraged.

The required element 'defaults' has the attribute 'list', which must be the
name of one of your lists, probably best set to your primary list.

One or more 'list' elements define a list. Multiple lists are useful for
keeping videos seperate by classification, or simply for multiple users.
Each 'list' element must have the 'name' attribute, this specifies the name
that this list goes by.

Each list may have one or more 'channel' elements. The required attribute
'name' is channel/user name that you wish to follow. The channel's name is
_not_ the full/pretty name that YouTube generally shows you. A channel's
real name may be seen in it's page's URL.
The optional attribute 'interval' specifies low long the daemon will wait
between polls of this channel.
This should be of the format <number><h|d|w|m>.
The optional attribute 'description' is just like what is sounds.

Each list may have zero or more 'highlight' elements. A 'highlight' element
specifies videos list entries that are to be highlighted. This is useful for
marking important videos. Any video that contains the substring specified by
the 'string' attribute, will be highlighted. If the attribute 'channel' is
also provided this substring matching will limited to only videos published
by the specified channel.
